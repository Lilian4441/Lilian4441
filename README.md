<h1> Hello there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Lilian Huang!</h1>


I am currently a computer science major in my second year at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am mainly learning Java in my intro computer science courses, but have been learning some C++ and Python on my own as well. I have a passion for coding projects. I intend to spend most of my summer practicing my coding skills and creative skills. I am very excited to broaden my knowledge of the different computer science languages, and just in general, learn more about the world of computer science.
