<h1> Hi there👋, Lilian here!</h1>


I'm a Dean's List student with a passion for technology and a love of learning. Currently on an exciting journey as a computer science major at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I'm learning so much about the world of algorithms, coding, and problem-solving.

With a strong work ethic and a genuine love for all things tech, I thrive on challenges and am always eager to explore new opportunities in the ever-evolving realm of computer science. Whether it's diving into coding projects or collaborating with fellow students, I'm always up for the challenge.

When I'm not buried in a computer science project, you can find me exploring the latest trends in the tech world, learning about all sorts of computer science concepts, or enjoying a good cup of chai while brainstorming ideas for projects. 🚀💻
